    <h3>Color Palette Choice</h3>
    <p>I wanted to establish a color palette for this stylesheet based on an image I liked so I used the <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/image">Adobe Color Theme from Image</a> tool
      and tried out a few different images. The image below is the source of the colors seen on this page!</p>

    <h3>Hi there!</h3>
    <p>My name is Mary and I began learning to code in January 2022. I am excited to be learning a new, invaluable skill.</p>
    <p>I am originally from Northern California, but I've lived in Seattle for the past four years.</p>
    <p>I lead a lowkey lifestyle, and enjoy spending time in my apartment with my partner and our cat, reading or
      listening to audiobooks, dabbling in film photography, and trying new restaurants. </p>
    <p>In March 2022, I am beginning the UW Certificate for UX and Visual Interface Design, which I am really looking
      forward to. I have been thinking about transitioning from my current role for a while, and when one of my mentors suggested I would excel as a UX Designer, I had to look up what a UX Designer does. Since learning about it, I realized how many of the aspects of my job that I like are related to creating the best experience, in both visual and interactive elements. So, upon deciding to pursue the UX Certificate, I decided I might as well dive right in and learn how to code as well. </p>

      <h3>My plans</h3>
    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-camera-retro"></i>One of the things I would like to do as I learn to code is to surprise my partner with a website for his photography.
      He has shared his interest in both film and digital photography with me and has talked about setting up a portfolio
      to share and sell his work. He is in school to become a Physical Therapist and doesn't have much time for working
      on this himself. </p>
      <p><i class="fa-solid fa-desktop"></i>Another way I would like to use my new skills is to take over managing the website of a non-profit
      my mom has been part of for a long time. I have been handling the formatting and editing of their newsletter for
      years, and my mom has even asked me about helping update their website. It sounds like the Board of the organization
      is mostly older, non-tech savvy folks and the person they currently have "managing" their website isn't as attentive
      or helpful as they would like. I would love to be able to bring their website up to par and help them expand their
      organization to a younger crowd!</p>
